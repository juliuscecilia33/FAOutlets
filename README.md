## About 
<p>FA (Food Allergy) Outlets is an E-commerce Store that combines all Food Allergy manufacturers and products into one online hub. With the website being built in React.js, Commerce.js, and Stripe.js, buyers are able to view all of their food allergy necessities from widespread, popular brands all in one site. </p>

## How it started
<p>After gaining some experience from my first project InstaDeck, I decided to start up a project that showcases a mainstream category of the web, E-commerce. Rather it be an ordinary store, I wanted my e-commerce store to serve a purpose, specifically for those who have food allergies. Having a sibling that can barely eat anything due to the severity of her food allergies, I understood how those with food allergies feel as they struggle to find food they can eat. With FA Outlets, buyers have an entire grocery hob in front of them accustomed for their food allergy needs with trusted, concentrated brands from Enjoy Life to King Arthur to SunButter. Many people underestimate the problem of food allergies in our world, and I hope to make people more aware of those with food allergies and at the same time assist those who have food allergies with the right and safe food for them. </p>

## Features
<p>By having a built-in payment feature through the integration of Stripe, buyers are easily able to pay for their products they choose with their credit card and are also given shipping options from all over the globe using Commerce.js’s limitless options. Buyers also have access to all the companies available to them in the site and each companies’ products listed as well. Before they are led to the payment information page, buyers can view their checkout cart page where they can view, edit, or delete the food-allergy products they have added to their cart. </p>

## Conclusion
<p>I had a lot of fun working on this project, especially in creating an e-commerce store that I hope to one day officially launch in the future! Most of all, it was just a great feeling to have to be able to take a step forwards towards helping people with food allergies as I understand the struggles they have from having a sibling born with extremely severe food allergies. I hope to extend FA Outlets to more of a social hub for people with food allergies, where they can share shopping lists they have or have created from FA Outlets, meet people with food allergies, write blogs that can be read by others needing your experience, and discovering foods or recipes you can eat as someone with food allergies. </p>
